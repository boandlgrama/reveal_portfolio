<p>Hi my Name is Manuel Hufnagel and I’m studying Mechanical Engineering at master’s degree with focus on robotics and automation. In Addition I’m a working student as a Software Engineer.</p>
<p>I’ve been a maker for several years. I have already realized some projects at home myself, but also participated in some Makeathons. I would be happy to see some of you at the <a href="https://projectmi5.com/live/10283-2/">Smart Green Island Makeathon 2019</a> in February on Gran Canaria.</p>
<p>My skills are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming (C/C++, Python, C#)</li>
<li>Electronics (Micorcontroller/Arduino, development and soldering of own circuits)</li>
<li>Linux (e.g. for Raspberry Pi)</li>
<li>Robotics (ROS)</li>
<li>control theory</li>
<li>3D printing</li>
<li>interdisciplinary thinking</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m really looking forward to implementing a cool project in a great team!</p>
