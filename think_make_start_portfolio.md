### Introduciton to myself

Hi my Name is Manuel Hufnagel and I'm studying Mechanical Engineering at
master's degree with focus on robotics and mechatronics. In Addition I'm a
working student as a Software Engineer.

I've been a maker for several years now. I have already realized some
projects at home myself, but also participated in some Makeathons. I would
be happy to see some of you at the [Smart Green Island Makeathon
2019](https://projectmi5.com/live/10283-2/) in February on Gran Canaria.


### My skills

* Programming (C/C++, Python, C#)
* Electronics (Micorcontroller/Arduino, development and soldering of own
  circuits)
* Linux (e.g. for Raspberry Pi)
* Robotics (ROS)
* control theory
* 3D printing
* interdisciplinary thinking

I'm really looking forward to implementing a cool project in a great team!
